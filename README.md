# SSH PROTOCOL (SECURE SHELL)

## SSH protocol definition

The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is a method of sending commands securely to a computer on an unsecured network. SSH uses cryptography to authenticate with a key and encrypt connections between devices. SSH also enables tunnelling, or port forwarding, i.e. packets can traverse networks that they would not otherwise be able to cross. SSH is often used to control servers remotely, to manage infrastructure and transfer files.

In this step-by-step exercise, I've set up a secure connection between my computer and an ubuntu virtual server on IONOS, using the SSH protocol.
